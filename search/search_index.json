I received my MApStat and MS in Biostatistics from LSU and OUHSC, respectively. In addition to BBMC, I work as a statistician and data programmer in a number of pediatric research projects. I was trained in biostatistics and epidemiology, and has research experience in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), HIV/AIDS clinical trials and child maltreatment prevention. I am interested in the applications of statistical computing and simulation, data analytics, dynamic reporting, automating tasks and real-time data decision making. I use mainly R, Python, SQL, and many other programming languages.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#bohora-better-open-hacks-on-recurring-actions","text":"Project documentation for Python package bohora","title":"bohora: better open hacks on recurring actions"},{"location":"#overview","text":"As the name suggests, this package provides some outstanding magical tricks/methods which are very useful and frequently encountered in research, statistics and data science.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"#few-examples","text":"is_palindrome() is_palindrome(\"Was It A Rat I Saw?\", remove_punctuation=True) True to_any_case() to_any_case(x, case = 'screaming_snake_case') 'THIS_IS_A_STRANGE_STRING_2' to_any_case(x, case = 'snake_case') 'this_is_a_strange_string_2' to_any_case(x, case = 'upper_camel_case') 'ThisIsAStrangeString2' to_any_case(x, case = 'upper_lower') 'thisISaSTRANGEstring2' to_any_case(x, case = \"parsed_case\") 'this_Is_a_Strange_string_2' to_any_case(x, case = \"swap_case\") 'THIS iS A sTRANGE_STRING 2' nepalese_words_to_number() x = \"ek karod paanch hajaar paanch saya paanch\" nepalese_words_to_number(x) 10005505 kmers_of() x = 'Find three kmers' kmers_of(x,3, remove_space=True) ['Fin', 'ind', 'ndt', 'dth', 'thr', 'hre', 'ree', 'eek', 'ekm', 'kme', 'mer', 'ers']","title":"Few Examples"},{"location":"#installation","text":"Here is the GitHub repository for bohora You can install bohora via GitHub $ git clone https://github.com/sbohora/bohora.git The following installation method is not currently available. $ pip install bohora","title":"Installation"},{"location":"#developer","text":"I am Som and am a statistician at The Department of Pediatrics, The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center .
